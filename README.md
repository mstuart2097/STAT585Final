Title: Simulating NFL Playoff Teams by Game Results

Abstract: Over the years, football has grown into America's pasttime, and American sports get no bigger than the National Football League.  While websites online allow fans to select winners and losers to create their own playoff field, it does not allow the entrance of ties -- which are possible -- nor does it allow fans to enter specific scores, which can alter playoff seeding.  While simulation analyses are available through various websites, they are not very user-friendly in terms of simulating with a specific game result already factored in.  The R Package, ProjectNFL, is based on these topics by providing NFL weekly game data for users obtained using webscraping, functions to break any ties using split-apply-combine functionality, and provide simulation results for teams to make the playoffs, including adding the ability to add specific game results in the simulation.
